<sinner> Y-yes, that is me.

<jury><~> (This one looks nervous. I shouldn't be too rough.)
<jury> As you know, you must be cleared of any sins you've committed before you enter the afterlife.

<sinner> W-what are you doing?
<jury> I am peering through your life experiences. Seeing your memories, as if I were you.

<narration><~> "Just do this one thing for me and go to the store to get that toy he keeps talking about."
<jury> That voice sounds like yours.
<sinner> It is me... I wish I never said that to him.

<jury> I think I see now.
<sinner> He didn't like me much after that day. When he moved out, he never talked to me again. I... I've never forgived myself.
